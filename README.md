# STA-309-Final
All my work and markdowns for the STA 309 Diabetes Analysis final:

### File One: STA309-Final
- Included in this file is the code for building my three training models, significant predictor pickings, and modeling my three models to compare accuracy. This includes everything on the rubric except for the dashboard build.

### File Two: Final_infographic_code
- Included in this file is the code for building my diabetes infographic. I utilized the framework code from file one to select the significant predictors of diabetes. From there I created a four plot dashboard that highlights box and whisker plots to indicate the four different predictors and there relationship with diabetes. This project was tough, but my dashboard and file one are both files I am proud of. Pictured below is my Diabetes Dashboard, and it can also be found in the Diabetes_Analysis.png
